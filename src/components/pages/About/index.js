                        <p>I am currently enrolled in a web development bootcamp provided by Triology Educations
                        Services' Full-Stack Coding Bootcamp, through the University of Texas at Austin.
                        The Bootcamp has given me the opportunity to learn both front end coding and  back end coding languages as well as React.js.
                        After completing the bootcamp, May 2020,  I plan to pursue a career in the coding field.

                        While there I was able to earn my certification as a Histology Technician and perform various aspects of histology to include: routine histology, muscle
                        enzyme histochemistry, electron microscopy, immunohistochemistry.
